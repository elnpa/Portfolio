    "The purpose of this report is to explore investment potential in the emerging green tourism sector, with a particular focus on luxury electric car rentals for travellers exploring Queensland's coastline. The analysis explores the elements that impact travellers' decision-making, analyses the desire for eco-friendly travel, and evaluates the benefits and limitations of the existing rental model. The findings from this analysis are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Thearts and Opportunities:** <br>\n",
    "Despite potential bias, an analysis of media sentiment showed a strong positive sentiment towards green tourism. Tourists looking for luxury vehicles for their Queensland road trips are more likely to choose electric vehicles over petrol. The positive sentiment in the media indicates potential for success in the green tourism sector. However, it also poses the threat of increased competition, especially from emerging businesses. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths and Weaknesses:** <br>\n",
    "The current model has advantages such as a large number of electric vehicles available at major airports in Southern Queensland, as well as the presence of charging stations along the coastline. However, the availability of electric vehicles in northern towns is limited, and rental locations are primarily centred in Queensland's southern half.\n",
    "\n",
    "A TOWS analysis is presented to address these findings, highlighting the opportunity to open a rental location in northern Queensland to cater to tourists returning their rental vehicles farther up the coastline. It is reccomended that this rental location be built in Cairns due to it's proximity with an international airport. This strategic move not only aligns with tourists' travel patterns but also benefits local economies and contributes to reducing CO2 emissions."

    "### Business Concern\n",
    "The overarching goal of this analysis is to identify an area or areas of investment that will likely result in success by taking advantage of the emerging green tourism market. The focus to achieve this will be through providing a way for tourists to roadtrip up the QLD coastline in luxury electric vehicles. As such it is imperative to gain deep insight into the external and internal factors that influence tourists' decision-making processes when planning a roadtrip. Understanding these factors will allow us to see gaps we can fill to provide a seamless, eco-friendly, and convenient rental experience, positioning our business as a top choice for tourists exploring the Queensland coast. \n",

    "The questions that will be answered are:\n",
    "- **Do tourists prefer green tourism options?**\n",
    "- **What is currently in place to provide a positive beginning, middle and end, electric vehicle rental experience for tourists travelling up the QLD coast?**\n",

    "- EV: electric and hybrid vehicles\n",
    "- QLD: Queensland\n",

    "### Scope\n",
    "- Only international airports will be used in the analysis as they all have dosmestic terminals and tourists typically fly into the bigger airports for the cheaper fares. \n",

    "### Assumptions\n",
    "- If tourists are choosing to do the road trip in a luxury vehicle, then cost isn't as important as other factors.\n",
    "- Positive or Negative Sentiment in the media is the same as public/tourist opinion. \n",
    "- As roadtrips will go up the QLD coast, tourists want to see/visit the Great Barrier Reef.\n",
    "- Roadtrips go from point A to point B, not point A to point A aka departing and returning to the same place\n"

  {

   "source": [
    "Our main goal for this analysis was to identify the best investment opportunity for electric vehicles in the growing green tourism sector. Our company aims to offer tourists the opportunity to enjoy luxury electric vehicle travel along the stunning Queensland coastline. To achieve this, it's crucial to allow tourists to return their rental cars in northern Queensland.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights gained throughout this report have given us a better understanding of how tourists plan their road trips. Considering the ethical factor of media bias, due to the general public's positive sentiment towards green tourism, our analysis identified that tourists renting luxury vehicles are more likely to choose an electric vehicle over petrol. Additionally, our company makes the start of their journey stress-free by providing multiple electric vehicles at the same locations as the three major international airports in southern Queensland – Gold Coast, Brisbane, and Sunshine Coast. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, to complete their trip, tourists must either retrace their route or return their vehicles to Rockhampton or Yeppoon. Without a location in northern Queensland, tourists might opt for another rental company, and we won't be able to offer them the chance to drive our luxury vehicles along the Queensland coast. Therefore it is recommended that a rental location be opened in Cairns and should be fitted with only electric vehicles. Cairns emerges as the ideal choice, as it allows us to have rental locations in the same place as all four international airports. Tourists are likely to book their trips around airports, as they serve as convenient entry and exit points for their journeys. Through this action, our company can also contribute to boosting tourism in numerous coastal towns. When tourists stop to charge their electric vehicles in the various available charging locations, they will likely be staying in hotels and dining in restaurants in the area, which will stimulate the local economy in these smaller towns.\n",
    "\n",
    "By establishing a rental location in Cairns, our company will not only be proactive in meeting the needs of tourists but also contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions by reducing the number of petrol vehicles on the road. This decision aligns with our company's commitment to environmental conservation and positions our business as a top choice for tourists travelling up the Queensland coast."

    "Elle, your report stands out for its unique and highly specific recommendations for the business, which I found particularly valuable. The sentiment analysis pie chart provides essential insights, although it's worth noting that the high skewness might be attributed to bias, which may be worth considering. While your markdowns are informative about your coding process, I would suggest explaining how the code can impact the analysis, and in some instances, elaborating on why it is instrumental in furthering the exploration of the data. Additionally, adding comments on the results or data outputs, and their relevance to the analysis, can enhance the reader's understanding. Expanding on the visuals' significance or their connection to the strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, or threats analysis can create a more seamless and informative transition. Lastly, I recommend including discussions on ethical factors and data limitations, as this will add human transparency to the analysis. Overall, your report is well-done and I enjoyed reading it."

All the figures you have chosen to use clearly convey the information they present and the flow of the report is very smooth (it was very easy to follow the narrative you created throughout. In the later stages of the report, the code is implemented and explained excellently but I felt that this was less present early in the report and a similar style of introducing each block of code would make the purpose more clear to the reader. There may be some benefit in discussing the potential bias of the articles from the Guardian, given they are overwhelmingly positive and from a single media source that may have editorial or political biases.
